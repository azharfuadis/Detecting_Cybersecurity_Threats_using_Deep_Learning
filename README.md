# Detecting_Cybersecurity_Threats_using_Deep_Learning
Develop a system that can detect Cyber Threats in your company's network traffic logs using Deep Learning.


**Project Description:**

Develop a system that can detect Cyber Attacks in network traffic. Utilizing PyTorch, you will train a neural network model and implement real-time anomaly detection. The goal is to improve network security by identifying and mitigating sophisticated cyber-attacks. 

**To Do:**
Train a neural network model to detect cyber attacks using PyTorch.
1. Define and train a model to detect anomalies in network traffic
2. Calculate the validation accuracy and save the metric as val_accuracy as an integer, aim for at least 0.6 accuracy.

Only run the training loop for 10 epochs due to the small dataset size.
